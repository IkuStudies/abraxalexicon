Step1 is installing dependencies.  my apologies if I missed any, if you kick a module not found error just add to this list and rerun
Step2 is feed the pdf into pdf2img to break down a pdf into images in a folder so pytesseract doesn't blow out the RAM
Step3 is to rename those images with just the last 3 numbers, if your pdf is over 999 pages adjust code accordingly
Step4 is to feed pytesseract.  might want to configure oem and psm depending on situation, but the configuration in the file 
         works well for converting the basic text into txt file maintaining spaces

the aim of the program is converting a corrupted or otherwise unformatted or unreadable pdf into a txt file
its pretty accurate but not perfect.  experimenting with configurations might be useful, but this did what I needed

just publishing the code and the method of extraction for the ancient greek for the abraxa lexicon.  
this added 30,000 ancient greek words from the english greek lexicon to the greek database.

any questions lmk
